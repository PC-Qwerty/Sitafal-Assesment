- Types of Visual Representations of Data
-  We use charts and graphs to visualize data.  This data can either be generated data, data gathered from an experiment, or data collected from some source.  A picture tells a thousand words so it is not a surprise that many people use charts and graphs when explaining data.

Query: What is the GDP of the manufacturing sector in 2015?
- • The chart below is called a pie chart. It shows what percent “of the pie” a particular category occupies out of the whole. • If total GDP in 2015 is the entire pie, then manufacturing makes up 19% of that pie and finance makes up 18%. Notice that visually speaking, since 19% and 18% are so close to each other in value, their respective slices of the pie are similarly sized. 2015 U.S. GDP (in millions of dollars) Manufacturing 19% Finance, insurance, real estate, rental, and leasing 18% Arts, entertainment, 59% recreation, accommodation, and food services Other 4%
- • The graph below is called a bar graph. • It shows each of the variables independent of each other, each with its own bar. • 2015 GDP for all industries was $31.397023; looking at the graph, the bar for all industries is just above $30. • One is still be able compare each variable with the other by comparing bars. 2015 GDP (in trillions of dollars) Other Arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation, and food services Finance, insurance, real estate, rental, and leasing Manufacturing All industries 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 Dollars

- Solution  The chart indicates that 15% of the income is spent on transportation. We must answer the question: 15% of $31,000 is what?  Writing as an equation and solving, we get  n = 0.15 x 31,000 = 4650  So the family spends $4650 on transportation yearly.
- • The graph below is called a line graph. It shows how a variable evolves with respect to another variable.
